# Quiz Builder/ Player
## A small project used to teach myself some of JQuery's intricacies.

The web-applet allows the user to both create and play created quizzes.  The creation screen allows the user to add and remove elements of the quiz. Once the user is satisfied with the quiz they can choose to save it as a JSON file. This JSON file can be used to play a quiz or if the user is not satisfied with the formation of the quiz, they can edit the quiz within the creation page.
